# Financial Data Analytics using Alteryx

## Overview of the project
### The project's objective is to analyze customer data and forecast future issues and concerns using machine learning models trained on historical data. 
### By leveraging Alteryx throughout the entire project, the goal is to identify optimal outcomes from the ML models to support business growth, address potential challenges, and offer tailored solutions for customers.

## Technology Stack
### Data Collection: Kaggle datasets & CSV format.
### ETL Process: Alteryx tool, Python, Machine Learning concepts for translation.
### Analytics and Visualization: Alteryx Designer.

### German Credit Eligibility Prediction:
In this project, we tackled the task of predicting the creditworthiness of individuals using data from a German credit CSV file. Leveraging Alteryx tools, we embarked on an end-to-end process encompassing ETL, 
data cleaning, and model deployment. After preprocessing the raw data, including selecting relevant features and oversampling, we experimented with four machine learning models: Logistic Regression, 
Decision Tree, Forest Tree, and Boosted models. Through rigorous evaluation, we found that the Logistic Regression model outperformed the others, providing the most accurate predictions. 
The results were visualized using Alteryx's browser tool, showcasing insightful charts and statistical data for enhanced understanding and decision-making.

### Bank Customer Clustering:
In this project, we delved into clustering analysis using data from a bank CSV file to categorize customers based on their attributes. Employing Alteryx tools,
we conducted ETL processes and constructed data pipelines to prepare the dataset for clustering models. Utilizing K-centroids diagnostics and cluster analysis models, we identified the optimal number of clusters 
and analyzed the characteristics of each cluster. The K-centroids cluster analysis model offered comprehensive insights into the distinct segments within the data, enabling deeper understanding and 
targeted strategies for customer engagement and retention.

### Credit Card Payment Prediction:
In this project, we aimed to predict credit card payment behavior using data from a credit card clients CSV file. Leveraging Alteryx tools, we performed ETL operations, data cleaning, and 
feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling. After assessing variable correlations and oversampling the data, we applied two machine learning models: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree. 
The Decision Tree model emerged as the preferred choice due to its superior accuracy and precision in predicting payment details for credit card clients. The results were presented using Alteryx's browser tool, 
ensuring clear and actionable insights for stakeholders.
